The TXT2WAVE file is a BASH script that depends on eSpeak and Lame being installed.
It needs to be "chmod +x" and copied to /usr/bin - alternatively, the way it's called can be changed in icecastbot.py
It's set to use the MBrola US1 voice as it sounds much better than the default eSpeak voices.

The bot itself depends on:
Python IRC Library

Shout Python is included in this repo, to install run:

python setup.py install
