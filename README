The TXT2WAVE file is a BASH script that depends on eSpeak and Lame being installed.
It needs to be "chmod +x" and copied to /usr/bin - alternatively, the way it's called can be changed in icecastbot.py

The bot itself depends on:
Python IRC Library
http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/

Shout Python is included in this repo, to install run:

python setup.py install
